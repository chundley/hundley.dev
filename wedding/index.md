  <p><strong>WEDDING INFO AND ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
  <p>We don't have a registry nor do we expect any gifts, seeing your wonderful faces and having time to visit is more than enough for us</p>
  <p>For those who are comfortable, we'd love for you to come prepared with a "favorite story" about Chris or Jodi to share with the group :)</p>
