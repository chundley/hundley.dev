<p><strong>WEDDING INFO AND ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>We don't have a registry nor do we expect any gifts, seeing your wonderful faces <br/>and having time to visit is more than enough for us</p>
<p>For those who are comfortable, we'd love for you to come prepared with a "favorite story"<br/> about Chris or Jodi to share with the group :)</p>
