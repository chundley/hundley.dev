Towards the end of the summer we were inspired by <a href="http://www.welcomepup.com/blog/how-to-build-an-outdoor-dog-potty-are/" target="_blank">this DIY project</a> and decided to take a swing at creating our own version.

We had two main problems with our four-legged best friends that we hoped to solve. <!--preview-->

1. The "big one" was using a narrow strip of dirt on the side of the house that she hated and actively avoided for a variety of reasons
2. The "little one" was going all over the place which made cleanup an inconvenient chore

# Materials
Based on the original blog post referenced above and some additional reading on how other people approached the project, I settled on the following supplies. Prices and location purchased aren't necessarily what I used, these are meant as references to help with your project:

- <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Construction-Select-2-in-x-6-in-x-10-ft-2-Ground-Contact-Hem-Fir-Pressure-Treated-Lumber-549000102061000/206931768" target="_blank">  Pressure treated 2x6 lumber</a> (x3 = $30)

Delivery charge was $79 and sales tax around $30.

**Total cost: $300**. Depending on the size of your dog(s), you could get away with less material. In our case we have:

- (1) Rhodesian Ridgeback ~80 pounds
- (1) Italian Greyhound ~18 pounds

You could also pick up the materials and save on delivery. I chose to have them brought to our house to make things easier.

With a smaller box you could get away with a lot less rock and maybe even go with just one layer.

# Location and size
The first order of business was deciding where to put the box and how big it would be. I settled on 10 feet by 5 feet which ended up being convenient since our neighborhood lumber yard was selling 2x6's in 10 foot lengths. This meant buying 3 pieces and splitting one in half.

Location was difficult because our back yard has a lot of slope and not a ton of space to maneuver. The initial idea was to remove a tree that sits on top of the area we decided on. Luckily as we were scheduling removal it occurred to me that we could leave the tree and have it sit inside the box.

This turned out to be a great call since the tree provides a little bit of shelter for them in the rain. Important for Seattle dogs!

# Step 1: Clearing the area
We had an abundance of small plants in the way - we had already decided we'd just remove them rather than try to re-plant. The yard already had too many. Here's what it looked like before we started (note the tree in the middle will be left intact):

# Step 2: Level and layout
Once I knew approximately where the box would go it was time to level out the area. To be honest, this was the toughest part of the project. THe yard was sloped in two directions from the center and there were a few nasty tree roots to deal with. Here's the area cleaned up and being leveled. I also trimmed up the bottom of the tree so the humans could more easily walk through the area.

Here is a view from the other side. Dirt was moved from the area closer to the camera here to the far side of the tree. This step took about two hours.

# Step 3: Box assembly





I decided to use a double layer of rocks suggested by the original design for optimal drainage.
