title: Bootstrapping 101 - the Lows
---
The road to success is long and arduous, there is little doubt that only the strongest (and luckiest) survive. Along the way you will experience amplified highs and lows, with the lows obviously more difficult to deal with.

Someone once asked me “what was the lowest point during the history of your company?” I hadn’t really thought about
it prior to this question, but my memory zeroed in on a specific moment almost immediately.

> It's not just one thing, it's the sum total of many things happening in short succession that cause the most intense highs and lows we experience in life.

# Desparation mode
The early days of any bootstrapped startup could be referred to as *desparation mode* when it comes to customer development. Any logo at any cost is the name of the game, even if it means building an entire feature set just to please a single key brand. It's easy to get taken advantage of because most B2B buyers are aware of this reality.

Other manifestations of desparation mode include willingness to travel just about anywhere at just about any time, manually fudging work you have sold as "automation", offering discounts or other incentives, and promising features or capabilities by some future date.

# The perfect storm
The story of the lowest point is a convergence of several disconnected situations that randomly came together in a single moment. I suppose this is typical of any apex scenario, whether good or bad. It's not just one thing, it's the sum total of many things happening in short succession that cause the most intense highs and lows we experience in life.

The day began like any other - and had the makings of a historically *good* day for the company. Three major items were on the agenda, two were customer related and one was more strategic. This last item was scheduled for the end of the day and would prove to be the cherry on top of this shit sundae.

Before we get there, let's back up to those customer wins for a moment. The first was something that had been in the works for about six weeks. A prospect had asked for additional functionality during the free trial process. Their request happened to align well with the product and was already on the future roadmap, so it made sense in those early days to move it up the priority list to get the business. In addition to the normal routine of running the business, I found the time during those six weeks to code up the requested feature to lock down another sale. And now it was time to close it.

The second customer development task for the day was an on-site visit to a local well-known public company. I had worked with someone who had recently taken a C-level job there, and this individual got me an introduction to the buyer. On the down-low, my ex co-worker had also assured me that they'd be an early adopter since it was obvious they needed the product. He just wanted me to pitch the person down the chain who would ultimately make the buying decision with his recommendation and approval. In the first year of a bootstrapped startup, these relationships are crucial in landing those first tough customers.

# An actual storm
The geography of the Seattle area sometimes leads to strange weather patterns. I needed to get to the west side of Lake Washington to find parking and take my first call from a coffee shop. It was a fairly nice day in early October as I walked out of my house.

By the time I got across the bridge, the rain had started. And it wasn't that typical, misty Seattle rain. It was a torrential downpoor. The sunshine and rainbows of the east side had made me
