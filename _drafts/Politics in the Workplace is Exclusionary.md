A recent change to the Salesforce Acceptable Use Policy stirred up some buzz regarding companies that sell firearms:

> Worldwide, customers may not use a Service to transact online sales of any of the following firearms and/or related accessories to private citizens. Firearms: automatic firearms; semi-automatic firearms that have the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and any of the following: thumbhole stock, folding or telescoping stock, grenade launcher or flare launcher, flash or sound suppressor, forward pistol grip, pistol grip (in the case of a rifle) or second pistol grip (in the case of a pistol), barrel shroud; semi-automatic firearms with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds; ghost guns; 3D printed guns; firearms without serial numbers; .50 BMG rifles; firearms that use .50 BMG ammunition. Firearm Parts: magazines capable of accepting more than 10 rounds; flash or sound suppressors; multi-burst trigger devices; grenade or rocket launchers; 80% or unfinished lower receivers; blueprints for ghost guns; blueprints for 3D printed guns; barrel shrouds; thumbhole stocks; threaded barrels capable of accepting a flash suppressor or sound suppressor.

I've never been a fan of companies taking these kinds of political positions but it's obviously well within their right to do so. Similarly it's well within a baker's rights to refuse service to someone based on political, religious, or personal ideology.

And make no mistake, this is political ideology and virtue signaling at it's most basic. It's easy to see this when you consider that selling a gun in the United States is **legal**. Benioff is imposing his personal political beliefs on company policy, mostly to generate PR. Again, **he has every right to do so**. It's just not something I like or would do myself.

Most of the people who cheer for a move like this are the **first ones** lining up to dox and flame a bakery for refusing to make a specific type of product. Fascism is only fun when it's our own flavor of control, am I right?

### We are an Inclusive Culture!
Except for those who don't fall immediately in line with our way of thinking.

While these public-facing virtue signaling tactics might be good for quick press coverage and a lot of Tweets espousing *stunning and brave*, they are cancer for the internal culture of a company.

It's true that the majority of folks working at tech companies lean a certain way politically. There is also a minority who **don't share** the same ideology or viewpoint.

The impact for those folks can result in:

* Alienation and a general sense that one isn't welcome
* Fear of speaking up or contributing a viewpoint that isn't mainstream
* Not wanting to be associated with a company that takes public positions in opposition to personal beliefs

When pressed too far, an otherwise healthy company ends up:

* Losing talented people who decide they don't fit in
* Reinforcing an ideological bubble that blinds them to other thoughts and opinions
* Ultimately losing customers who either don't agree politically or are just turned off by pointless virtue signaling rhetoric

### Exclusion
Companies take a lot of pride in creating inclusive cultures. All genders, races, and orientations should feel safe, be heard and supported. **This is a good thing, and what progress looks like**.

It's regressive, however, to allow political ideology to suppress or marginalize employees who think or believe differently than the CEO, founders, or executives setting the policies and culture of the company.

For me, inclusion means all races, genders, orientations, and the free form expression of **ideas** are worth protecting. I may not share the same belief as you, but I damn sure don't have a right to prevent you from engaging in the conversation.

Once again I'll emphasize that Benioff (as any CEO or business owner) can freely choose who they do business with. The argument I'll make is that **it creates an exclusionary culture which is ultimately bad for the organization**.

### Where does this lead?
At what point will companies be forced to add political questions to the interview process? If a CEO of a small startup is fervently pro-life, should that CEO be allowed to ask abortion questions during an interview?

For Benioff, the timing (shortly after a mass shooting) in making this change should be seen for what it is: **opportunistic pandering and virtue signaling for clicks**.

Why does SalesForce do business with predatory lending companies? How about banks or institutions that were responsible for the housing crisis that impacted millions of people?

In fact, SalesForce <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/customer-success-stories/papa-murphys/" target="_blank">has a case study with Papa Murphy's</a> - a company who's CEO was forced to step down after making statements about the NFL hurting sales by allowing players to take a knee during the National Anthem. This was perceived as racist by some.

Before long every person, group, or company will have said or done something that offends someone else. It is inevitable.

For example, try getting four random people in a room to agree on *any* opinion such as "what is the best movie of all time?" I personally know someone who believes the Harry Potter franchise contains the best movies ever made. Should the fact that this opinion runs counter to my own prevent me from being this person's friend, or doing business with them?

### An Opportunity?
If organizations choose to exclude business relationships that don't fall in line with a specific ideology, perhaps this should open a competitive opportunity.

Imagine a company that's **truly inclusive**. Not just based on skin color, gender, or sexual orientation, but on *ideas* as well. That's the kind of company I would be proud to create.

Or better yet, just **leave politics to the politicians**. Virtue signaling and pandering to half of the population alienates the other half. What you are doing is further silencing and excluding a measurable percent of your employees.

I'll leave you with a question: what, **exactly**, is the upside of a company making such politically polarizing statements?
